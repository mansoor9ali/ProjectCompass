Running ProjectCompass and Testing with demo.py
I'll guide you through setting up and running the ProjectCompass application, with specific focus on testing with the demo.py script.

Step 1: Set Up the Environment
First, let's create and activate a virtual environment for the project:

powershell
CopyInsert
# Navigate to your project directory
cd c:\Projects\ProjectCompass

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate
Step 2: Install Dependencies
Once your virtual environment is activated, install the required packages:

powershell
CopyInsert
# Install from requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install the packages directly
pip install robocorp robocorp-tasks rpaframework rpaframework-core rpaframework-email fastapi uvicorn jinja2 pandas scikit-learn nltk spacy pydantic python-dotenv
Step 3: Download Additional Resources
Install the required NLTK data and spaCy model:

powershell
CopyInsert
# Download NLTK data
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt'); nltk.download('stopwords')"

# Download spaCy model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
Step 4: Running the Demo
Now you can run the demo.py script to test the system with sample email inquiries:

powershell
CopyInsert
# Make sure you're in the project directory with your virtual environment activated
python demo.py --email-type prequalification
You can test different types of inquiries by changing the --email-type parameter:

powershell
CopyInsert
# Test a finance inquiry
python demo.py --email-type finance

# Test a contract inquiry
python demo.py --email-type contract

# Test a technical issue inquiry
python demo.py --email-type technical_issue
Step 5: Running the Full Application
After testing with the demo, you can run the complete application:

Run the Email Inquiry Processor:
powershell
CopyInsert in Terminal
python -m tasks email_inquiry_processor
Run the Dashboard:
powershell
CopyInsert in Terminal
python -m tasks run_dashboard
Run the API Server:
powershell
CopyInsert in Terminal
python api.py
